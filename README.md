# About me 


- ðŸ”­ Currently studying Artificial Intelligence at Politecnico di Milano, before that I graduated in Automation and Control Engineering but I decided to change path 
     and focus on something I was more passionate about.
  
- ðŸ¤” Any kind of help is very appreciated, I still have an infinite amount of things to learn: from basic programming concepts and software design patterns, to complex machine learning algorithms,
    I'd love to ear about it, even just for the sake of curiosity.
